6. Recurrent laryngeal N/surounding structure (intact/intact)
7. Q block 1.5g/hemoblock/Megaderm/tacoseal/veraseal 2 4ml/Megashield 3cc

@1. The patient was placed in comfortable supine position
2. The 6cm sized incision was done by 15 knife
3. The plastysma m. was divided with the cutting cautery.
4. The strap m. are separated.
5. The thyroid lobe(Rt.) was exposed by mobilizing the strap m.(sternohyoid and sternothyroid m.)
6. The middle vein was exposed, divided, and ligated.
7. Baccock clamps were applied to inferior and superior aspects of the thyroid lobe(Rt.&Lt.) to facilitate medical retraciting on the gland
8. Superior pole vessels were divided individually, and then ligated without external laryngeal nerve and vocal cord injury.
9. A gentle dissection with Hoyt clamp was used to exposure the parathyroid gland, inferior thyroid a. and recurrent laryngeal n.
10. The branches of the inferior thyroid artery were divided at the surface of the thyroid gland
11. The inferior thyroid vein was ligated and divided
12. The dissection of thyroid from the trachea was performed with cautery by division of loose connective tissue.
13. After identifying the parathyroid gland, inferior artery and recurrent laryngeal n. thr thyroid was divided so that the isthmus included in the specimen.
14. Barovac 100cc was inserted. After indenification of no bleeding, fascia and skin was closed with vicryl 3-0 and vicryl 4-0, PDS 5-0, silk 6-0, skin stapler ,allevyn thin 10*10.
