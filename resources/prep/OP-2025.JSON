Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed.

Protractor \r\nwas used for self retractor.\r\n\r\n Diluted vasopressin was injected in the subcapsular area and transverse incision was made \r\non the most prominent portion of the uterus. The myoma was exposed and clamped with tenaculum \r\nforceps and was mocerllated as was being enucleated and removed from the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n The uterine closure was done with interrupted deep sutures without permitting dead space \r\nin full thickness. We also confirmed adequate hemostasis on the myomectomy sites by \r\nendoscopic examination. All the blood in the pelvic cavity was drained. The endometrial cavity \r\nwas not exposed.\r\n\r\n The patient tolerated well throughout the whole procedure.\r\n\r\nEstimated blood loss: 30 cc\r\nThe count of gauze and operative instruments: correct\r\nThe weight of specimen: 170 gram\r\nAmount of diluted vasopressin: 50 cc\r\n\r\nscrub nurse: 김태영"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the medial margin, superiorly to superior margin, laterally to the lateral margin , and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi. Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.\r\nsentinel LN biopsy  was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein. The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist. The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection. Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided. The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein. The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved. The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection. \r\nTwo H-VAC 400cc  drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit. The most posterior of the2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

The peritoneum overlying \r\nthe lower uterine segment was pulled up and incised transversely, the bladder was slipped \r\ndown. The uterine incision was made transversely with a knife, amnionic membrane was \r\nseen then the incision was enlarged with both index fingers laterally.\r\n\r\n Baby was delivered, umbilical cord was doubly clamped, cut and the baby was delivered to an \r\nassistant. For rapid uterine contraction, 20 unit of pitocin was mixed into the running I.V. \r\nfluid. After grasping the edge of the incised uterine wall with Allis clamps, the deeper \r\nlayer and the superficial layer of the myometrium was closed with continuous unlocked sutures \r\nof GLSORB 1-0. Hemostasis was assured and remaining blood and amnionic fluid in the abdominal \r\ncavity were cleansed out. \r\n\r\n Abdominal wall was closed in layers; a continuous suture of chromic catgut 2-0 for the \r\nperitoneum and the rectus muscles; the simple running sutures of GLSORB 2-0 for the fascia \r\nand the subcutaneous tissues; and the skin with nylon 3-0.\r\n\r\n After operation, there was no active vaginal bleeding at vaginal dressing.\r\nThe patient tolerated the entire procedure well and was sent to recovery room in stable \r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nEstimated blood loss: 800 cc\r\nThe count of gauze and operative instruments: correct\r\n@"}

The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further. Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to medial margin border , superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the lateral border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying tumor . Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Frozen biopsy about margin were taken. \r\nThe axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein. sentinel Lymph node was taken  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection. Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided. The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein. \r\nOne H-VAC 400cc drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin.

In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Local anaesthetic is infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and a small skin incision no larger than the tip of the probe is made in the skin. Further local anaesthetic is then injected into the deeper tissue using a spinal or similar needle positioned under direct ultrasonic visualisation, infiltrating along the planned Mammotome track and around the lesion. Ten millilitres of 1% or 2% Xylocaine with 1 in 200 000 adrenaline is usually adequate. \r\n\r\nThe probe is inserted in 'positioning' mode, with the aperture closed. A blade on the tip of 8-gauge probe helps it to pass cleanly through the tissues. The probe is generally positioned so that the aperture (which can be readily identified on ultrasound, even in the closed position) lies immediately behind the lesion, although some larger lesions may be more easily removed by being transfixed by the probe. The system is then switched to 'sampling' mode, and lesion removal can begin. If the probe is correctly positioned posterior to the lesion, the mass can be seen being sucked into the specimen aperture as the 'forward' button l is depressed.\r\n\r\nProgress of lesion removal is usually well seen on ultrasound, although occasionally completeness of removal can be difficult to assess due to the presence of air and\/or blood in the cavity.This is done by incrementally rotating the holster between samplings when the probe aperture is closed. In addition, elevation of the probe as the lesion is progressively removed may help the remaining part of the lesion to enter the aperture. \r\n\r\nThe number of cores required to obtain complete lesion removal is very variable, depending on the size of the lesion, the gauge of probe used and the position of the probe relative to the lesion.\r\n\r\nFollowing withdrawal of the probe, firm pressure is applied for several minutes to the area of tissue removal A pressure dressing is then applied. \r\n\r\nthe epidermis is approximated with nylon #5 \r\nthe skin is cleaned dired and apply a simple gauze dressing and a surgical bra\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
