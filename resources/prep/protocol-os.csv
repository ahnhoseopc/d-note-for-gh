The arm was positioned in approximately 70\'a1\'c6of abduction and 20\'a1\'c6of frontal flexion. Ten pounds of traction was applied. A posterior portal was created 1cm medial and 2 to 3cm caudal to the posterolateral corner of the acromion. The anterior portal was created after the posterior portal by passing the anthroscope, under visual control, superior and anterior to the biceps tendon in the rotator interval. A probe was inserted to anterior and posterior portal, systemic examination of right shoulder joint was performed. generally, severe degenerative change were observed. There were seen partial tear of rotator cuff.  The arthroscope was removed from the posterior cannula and a switching stick was advanced anteriorly through the capsule and into a subcutaneous position lateral and cephalad to the coracoid process. The anterior midglenoid(AMG) portal was created in an outside to inside fashion. A 5mm superficial skin incision was made 2cm inferior to the anterosuperior(AS) portal and 1cm lateral to the coracoid process. An cannula with blunt obturator was then passed through the anterior structure and penetrated the joint. Rotator cuff repair were super anchor x1. With the arthroscope in the AS portal, a shaver was introduced through the AMG portal and used to initially debride scar tissue, labral, cartilage debris. All instrument were removed.A superficial counter incision was made and a cannula was advanced over deltoid muscle line. And bone drilling and suture of bone to muscle of supraspinatus.

A superficial counter incision was made and a cannula was advanced over the switching stick into the joint in a retrograde fashion. The anterior midglenoid(AMG) portal was created in an outside to inside fashion. A 5mm superficial skin incision was made 2cm inferior to the anterosuperior(AS) portal and 1cm lateral to the coracoid process. An cannula with blunt obturator was then passed through the anterior structure and penetrated the joint. With the arthroscope in the AS portal, a shaver was introduced through the AMG portal and used to initially debride scar tissue, labral, cartilage debris. And SLAP lesion repair with GII anchor.
