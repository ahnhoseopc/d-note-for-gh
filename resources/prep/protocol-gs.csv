\viewkind4\uc1\pard\lang1042\f0\fs20 PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rt breast tumor wide excision and Lt breast partial mastectomy 
\par ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal tube.
\par PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.
\par An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the previous biopsy site. The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further. Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to medial margin border , superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the lateral border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying tumor . Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Frozen biopsy about margin were taken. 
\par The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein. sentinel Lymph node was taken  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection. Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided. The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein. 
\par One H-VAC 400cc drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.
\par The skin incision was approximated with suture. A dressing was applied. The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction. All surgical counts were reported as correct.
\par Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition

Submuscular undermining is continued by harvesting the deep fat(zone6) and by carefully ligating or coagulating the accessory pedicles When the lattimus dorsi is completely undermined its distal part is transected, from the deep part t","oward the surface, as horizontally as possible in order to include as much fat bulk as possible , in particular zone 5 of the flap In the axillary region, the pedicle is then freed so that it can be transposed without tension or kinking, and the lattisimus dorsi tendon is transacted The pedicle is approached posteriorly by releasing the teres major from the latissimus dorsi in a distal to proximal direction. Fibers that are common to the latissimus dorsi and the teres major and meet at the point of the scapula are transected The two muscles are separated by remaining close to the teres major The origin of the latissimus dorsi pedicle is identified by following the pedicle of serratus anterior up to the Y-shaped bifugation The branch of the serratus anterior should be carefully preserved to ensure blood supply to the flap if there is a lesion of the thoracodorsal pedicle To make flap transposition easier, the scapular angular artery is ligated when the pedicle has been identified, a finger is passed under the tendon to protect it during partial proximal section of the tendon Only a muscle bridge a few millimeters in diameter is preserved in order to avoid any tension on the pedicleThe flap is then ready to be transposed to the breast area via a subcutaneous tunnelThe donor site is closed after irrigation of the whole area of the undermining in order to obtain a perfect hemostasis.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\ltrpar\nowidctlpar\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qj\kerning2\f0\fs20 Detail of Procedure
\par A typical placement for access ports is shown at the umbilicus , left lower quadrant , and lower midline . As in most laparoscopic procedures, some form of triangulation is employed, with the longest and widest angle given to the operating ports and instruments. The videoscopic port is created first . ( Although some use an initial inflation of the abdomen with a Veress needle, most general surgeons employ the open Hasson technique. The surgeon may enter at the superior or inferior margin of the umbilicus with either a vertical or semicircular transverse incision . After the Haason port is placed and secured with the stay sutures, the abdomen is inflated with CO2. The surgeon sets the maximum gas pressure(<15mmHg) and flow rate while he or she monitors the actual intraabdominal pressure and the total volumn of gas insufflated . the abdomen then enlarges and becomes tympanic
\par The videoscope is attaced to the telescopic instrument, which may be straight(zero degress) or angled. The system is white balanced and the focus adjusted. After the optical end of the instrument has been cleaned with antifog solution, it is introduced down the Hasson port. A careful visualization of all four quadrants of the abdomen is performed and a record is made of all normal and abnormal findings
\par Under direct vision with the videoscope, two additional 5mm ports are put into the abdomen. One is in the left lower quadrant and is placed lateral to the rectus muscle with its epigastric vessels. The light of the videoscope is used to transilluminate the abdominal wall at the proposed site so as to avoid trocar placement through vessels in the oblique muscles. (The surgeon infiltrates the 5mm site with local anesthesia) this infiltrating needle can be advanced through the abdominal wall and the videoscope will see the needle enter the anticipated site for this port. A 5mm skin incision is made and the subcutaneous tissue dilated with a small hemostat down to the level of the fascia. The 5mm port is placed through the abdominal wall while the surgeon views the safe entrance of the pointed trocar into the intraperitoneal space. The third port is placed through the midline linea alba in a suprapubic position so as to avoid the bladder, which has been  decompressed with a Foley catheter. The strategy for a widely spread (hand's breadth) triangular pattern of port placement now become apparent as the three instruments compete for room to maneuver. 
\par The patient is placed in the Trendelenburg  position and the right side of the operating table may be elevated using gravity to hold the small bowel away from the right lower quadrant. (If"," a normal appendix is found, a search for other inflammatory processes is begun. Tubo-ovarian diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and Meckel's diverticulitis are most commonly found.) The appendix and its mesentery must be clearly visualized. (The position of the appendix is quite variable, and it may be covered with peritoneum or even the cecum. Safe opening of any peritoneal covering or the equivalent of the lateral line of Toldt along the cecum may require placement of an additional operating port . If the surgeon cannot obtain complete visualization of the appendix, mesoappendix, and base of the cecum for a safe transection, the operation is coverted to an open procedure)
\par Laparoscopic removal begins with a splaying out of the mesoappendix using a grasping forceps upon the mesentery . the inflamed tip of the appendix is not grasped, as this could cause it to rupture. The surgeon opens through the mesentery at the base of the appendix using a dissecting instrument. If maneuvering of the appendix and its mesentery is difficult using the grasping forceps, some surgeons prefer to lasso the inflamed end of the appendix with a loop suture that is applied snugly. The cut end of this suture may be grasped more securely with the maneuvering forceps. The mesoappendix is divied in one or more transection using an endoscopic vasucular stapling instrument that is passed through the large Hasson port. This assumens that a 5mm videoscope is available for use through the left lower quadrant port. Otherwise the left lower quadrant port is enlarged to 10mm as both the videoscope and endoscopic vascular stapler require  large ports. The base of the appendix is divied with the endoscopic cutting linear stapler. An important maneuver with any division using this staple is to rotate it about 180 degresss, so as to visualize the entire length and the contents within its jaws . this rotation should also be done during the stapling of the mesoappendix. 
\par A small minimally inflamed appendix can be removed safely through the shaft of a 10mm port. Most surgeon place an enlarged or suppurative appendix into a plastic bag for removal through the abdominal wall. This lessens the chance of infection at the surgical site. The appendiceal stump and stapled mesoappendix are inspected for security and hemostasis. The area is lavaged with the suction irrigation and a regional inspection is made to verify the integrity of the cecum and small bowel. Each of the 5mm port is removed under direct vision with the videoscope to make sure that there are no bleeding abdominal wall vessels. 
\par Closure 
\par The abdomen is decompressed and the Hasson port removed. Routinely only the 10mm port sites require facial closure . Scarpa's fascia and the subcutaneous fat are not closed. The skin is approximated with fine  #  absorbable sutures 
\par Adhesive skin strips and small dry sterile dressing are applied

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\lang1042\f0\fs20 circumareolar incision  was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site. The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further. Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the medial margin, superiorly to superior margin, laterally to the lateral margin , and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi. Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\ltrpar\sb100\sa100\b\f0\fs24 PROCEDURE PERFORMED: \b0 Modified radical mastectomy.
\par \b ANESTHESIA: \b0 General endotracheal tube.
\par \b PROCEDURE: \b0 After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.
\par An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site. The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further. Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi. Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.
\par The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein. The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist. The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection. Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided. The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein. The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved. The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection. As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved. The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field. Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.
\par Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit. The most posterior of the ","2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major. These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.
\par The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was applied. The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction. All surgical counts were reported as correct.
\par Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition

\par the skin incision is made along the V shaped markings 
\par on both sides it is carried 1.0cm ~1.5cm into the lower portion of the new areolar site
\par for subcutaneous dissection of the lower portion of the gland, the skin margins are clamped with forceps to allow superficia dissection
\par under tension, similar to a subcutaneous mastectomy subcutaneous dissection extends over both inferior quadrants into the inframammary fold
\par Here the tissue is incised down to the muscle on the chest wall
\par next the superiorly based nipple pedicle is elevated After the skin incision a 2cm thick layer of the inferior part of the nipple flap is clamped with two ring forceps 
\par dissection then proceeds vertically aroud the entire flap , slightly beveling away from the flap 
\par the flap is the elevated from the parenchyma obliquely as far as the upper margin of the areolar 
\par the next step involves dissecting the central tissue of the gland off the chest wall or pectoralis muscle  subglandular dissection begins at the level of the inframammary fold 
\par after the tough connective tissue attachment of the glandular tissue has been cut at the lateral border of the pectoralis muscle dissection continues bluntly up to about the third intercostal space 
\par the gland is raised to its superior margin over 6~8cm wide central tunnel 
\par central dissection allows the breast to move superiorly as a type of overcorrection 
\par Excess parenchyma is mainly removed from the central and inferior portions of the breast 
\par Starting at the cutaneous incision line the medial and lateral parenchyma is incised down to the chest wall 
\par this also forms the two lateral pillars , which will be approximated later in the operation 
\par depending on the extent of reduction necessary, the parenchyma may also be resected posteriorly from the lateral pillars 
\par the lateral pillars must be shortened if they exceed 6~7cm in length 
\par after sufficient hemostasis the mastopexy suture is placed. Slowly absorbing suture material is used 
\par deep suture is placed through the pectoralis muscle at the upper border of the breast parenchyma and opposite it at the upper limit of the 
\par parenchyma excision, usually at the level of the superior margin of the areola, 
\par the nipple arolar complex is moved superiorly by affixing the upper border of the areolar with absorbable 4.0 suture material at the upper border of the de epithelized skin
\par the next step, approximation of the breast pillars, is another important part of achieving proper breast contour and shape 
\par absorbable 3 sutures are placed through the breast pillars the sutures are placed through the parenchyma and pulled through the subcutaneous fatty tissue
\par the desired bresat breast shape can be achie","ved by adjusting tension and the threads 
\par preliminary approximation of the skin margins can reveal where subcutaneous dissection may still be needed 
\par tightening of the skin has now visibly raised the breast and thus the inframmary flol 
\par the lower limit of the vertical skin incision should therefore also be fixed to the lower border of the breast 
\par Drains are placed inferolaterally the second subdermal suture is then placed at the lower boder of the areola
\par the wound is then closed and excess skin tightened finally an intracutaneous suture with absrobable 4 suture material is placed 
\par afterward the areolar is sutured in layes with suddermal and intracutaneous sutures
\par A sterile elastic pressure bandage is applied aroud the chest

The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi. Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.
\par The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein. The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist. The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection. Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided. The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein. The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved. The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection. As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved. The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field. Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.

\par PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.
\par incision overlying previous skin scar  was made to remove of silicone bag . The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further. Using traction and counter-traction, silicone bag was removed without rupture.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl. fibrotic capsule was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely. One H-VAC 200cc drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was applied. The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition
